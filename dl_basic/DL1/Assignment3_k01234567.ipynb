Since convolutions are known to be useful for image processing, CNNs have become a powerful tool for learning features from images. However, they have proven to beat alternative architectures in a variety of other domains."

    "\n",
    "The *weight sharing* in convolutional neural networks can drastically reduce the memory requirements for the weights. This effectively allows the input data to become larger, but since we need to store parts of the forward pass for back-propagation, the gains are rather limited. Of course, standard convolutions reduce the spatial dimensions, but this linear reduction is often too slow to counter the increased memory requirements due to network depth."

A pooling layer reduces the spatial dimensions by combining a window of pixels to a single pixel. By sticking a pooling layer after every convolutional layer, the spatial dimensions are reduced exponentially, rather than linearly. This allows convolutional neural networks to process big chunks of data.\n",

    "In modern convolutional neural networks, *strided* or *dilated* convolutions (see visualisations below) are often preferred over pooling. With strided convolutions, the windows are shifted The main advantage of strided or dilated convolutions over pooling is that they can be learnt. This means that instead of relying on a fixed pooling technique, it is possible to effectively learn how the pixels in the window are to be summarised. Also note that average pooling can indeed be represented as a strided convolution with weights $\\frac{1}{\\text{window size}}$."
